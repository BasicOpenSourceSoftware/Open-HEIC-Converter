OHC will ask for a filepath to pull heic images from then for a filepath to save them to. Once you select it, OHC will convert and save every HEIC image in the folder and tell you if any files failed.
The release ZIP file is a compiled version using pyinstaller. There is no insaller but you will want to unZIP the file then use the exe to launch the application. You can also make a short cut it does not matter where you save the folder.

There is no copy right on this project, although I would appriciate if anyone who uses the code from my projects give some credit or a mention.
